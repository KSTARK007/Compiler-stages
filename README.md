# Compiler-stages
In this repository I am trying to demo all the major different phases of a C# compiler
## Constraints handled
 1. FOR
 2. WHILE
 3. nested IF ELSE
 4. CLASS
 
## Different stages handled 

1. Lexical analysis (Tokenized scanning)
2. Parser and Syntax analyzer and semantic analyzer (Using C# grammar for the above mentioned constraints) 
	1. Abstract syntax tree (AST)
3. Intermediate code generator (ICG)
4. Intermediate code optimizer (IGO)

## Usage
``` bash
$ chmod 777 run.sh
$ ./run.sh
```
